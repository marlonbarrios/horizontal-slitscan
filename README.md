# Horizontal SlitScan (Soft Space #2)

SlitScan are imaging techniques are used to create static images of time-based phenomena. In traditional film photography, 
slit scan images are created by exposing film as it slides past a slit-shaped aperture. In the digital realm, thin slices are extracted 
from a sequence of video frames, and concatenated into the creation of a new image.
Granulation of a 3D printer's operating sound is influenced by the pixel colours at the current scan point.

Enjoy the space here:
It works better in Chrome and Brave.

*INVITATION TO DANCERS AND MOVERS:*

I would love to create a collection of performances within these software spaces for an online exhibition.
If you make a recording please share it with me at  marlon@dance-tech.net
Thre may be some compensation via MotionDAO.



## Soft Spaces:

It is series of classic video processing algorithms that uses the webcam input as a source and the browser as performance space; 
it helps us to rediscover the affordances of movement and perception augmented by computational systems and strategies. The space of
the frame is choreographed and remapped in coupling with user/performer. Soft Spaces represent the cognitive continuity of software, 
interface and embodiment. They are invitations to create and compose. How do they soaces make you move?" 

Created for MotionDAO experiments in NFTs that invite to move.
